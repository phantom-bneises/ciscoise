<h2>Getting ERS credentials</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Enable Ers</h3>
        <p>ERS uses on HTTPS port 9060 which is by default closed. Clients trying to access this port without enabling ERS first, will face a timeout from the server.
        Therefore, the first requirement is to enable ERS from the Cisco ISE admin UI. Go to <b>Administration > Settings > ERS Settings</b> and enable the Enable ERS
        for Read/Write radio button</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Creating ERS Admin</h3>
        <p>Go to <b>Administration > Settings > ERS Settings</b> and then from the panel on the left select <b>Admin Users</b> under administrators.
            Now add an account by clicking <b>Add > Create an admin user</b>. Then enter name and password and select <b>ERS Admin</b> in Admin Group and then press saves</p>
    </li>
</ol>
